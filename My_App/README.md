# RIIM Empty User Application

## Description
This is an almost empty project that you may use to build your own. It includes minimal
applications for a Border Router, Sensor Board and Developement Board - or your custom board.

## To use this example:
- Set up the computer as described in the user manual
- Use the **Compile_And_Upload** script or use MAKE manually to generate and upload the images
- On the terminal, you should see a start message on each of the boards.
